# Risk Analysis, Risk Control Models and Case Studies

## Project Overview

Welcome to this repository! Based on my extensive experience in banking risk analysis, this repository aims to share models, case studies, and best practices related to risk analysis and risk control. I hope these resources will benefit professionals in risk management and data analysis fields.

## Repository Contents

### Models

  - Credit Scoring
  - Default Probability Prediction using Logistic Regression
  - Exposure at Risk Calculation Methods
- **Market Risk Models**
  - Value at Risk (VaR) Model
  - Scenario Analysis and Stress Testing
- **Operational Risk Models**
  - Monte Carlo Simulation
  - Event Loss Distribution Analysis

### Case Studies
- **Case 1**: Analize the risk of oil data with decision tree modeling
- **Case 2**: Forecasting Market Risk using Time Series Analysis
- **Case 3**: Building an Operational Risk Monitoring System for Banks

### Tools and Techniques
- **Programming Languages**: Python, R, SQL
- **Libraries and Frameworks**:
  - Data Processing: Pandas, NumPy
  - Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
  - Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, XGBoost
  - Risk Modeling: Statsmodels, PyMC3

## Getting Started
